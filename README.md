# Simple-Machine-Learning-Model

Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of two powerful ensemble learning methods, Bagging Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, to build and evaluate a simple machine learning model. Both methods use multiple base models (typically decision trees) to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions by reducing variance and preventing overfitting.

Algorithms Used
Bagging Classifier:

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble method that improves the accuracy of machine learning models by training multiple base models (often decision trees) on different random subsets of the data and averaging their predictions.
The key advantage is its ability to reduce variance and prevent overfitting, especially in high-variance models like decision trees.
Random Forest Classifier:

Random Forest is an extension of bagging that further improves model performance by introducing additional randomness during training. It constructs multiple decision trees, but at each split in the tree-building process, only a random subset of features is considered.
It helps in reducing variance while maintaining a low bias, making it a powerful model for classification tasks.
Key Steps in the Project
Data Preprocessing:
Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
Handled missing values, scaled numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.
Model Building:
Built a Bagging Classifier using Scikit-learn's BaggingClassifier with decision trees as the base model.
Built a Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluated both models using cross-validation to assess performance across different splits of the data.
Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare model performance.
Model Comparison:
Compared the performance of Bagging and Random Forest on the test data.
Evaluated the impact of ensemble learning on model performance compared to a single decision tree classifier.
Skills and Tools
Ensemble Learning: Bagging, Random Forest.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas.
Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Python: Used Python for building and evaluating the models, visualizing results.
Results
The Random Forest Classifier typically outperforms the Bagging Classifier in terms of accuracy due to its additional randomness, which reduces the risk of overfitting.
Both models performed significantly better than a single decision tree classifier, demonstrating the power of ensemble methods in improving model accuracy and stability.
